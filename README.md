# Eye-Exercise

This exercise creates a webpage that displays two eyeballs in the center of the window that follow the movement of the mouse. 

How to Run: Save all files to the same folder and open index.html file in new window.

Future Improvements: I may choose to revisit this exercise to implement more eyeballs or change the layout and style of the webpage.
